# wgs_protocol
Code for summarizing the data obtained from the workflow published in STAR Protocols.

This framework integrates multiple stages of bioinformatic processing, including sequencing read quality filtering, de novo genome assembly, and functional annotation. It further enables precise genetic characterization through Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), agr and spa typing, and Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) classification. Additionally, this workflow provides robust detection of key genomic features, including Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs), Virulence Factors (VFs), plasmids, and prophages.
